## 1. Shell Internship Project
Project, Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning, leverages data-driven techniques to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crop and fertilizer based on soil composition, weather conditions, and nutrient levels. Using the Crop Recommendation Dataset and Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset, the system processes data, performs feature selection, and trains machine learning models. The Random Forest Classifier is used for crop recommendation, while the Decision Tree Classifier predicts the optimal fertilizer. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate recommendations. Additional visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps help in better understanding data correlations. The model is further improved by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features for better performance. 

## 2. Medical Diagnosis Using AI
Medical Diagnosis Using AI, leverages machine learning techniques to predict chronic diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s. It utilizes structured medical datasets, applies data preprocessing and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key health indicators. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, are trained to classify disease risk with high accuracy. The model achieves 91% accuracy for Parkinson’s, 88% for Heart Disease, and 85% for Diabetes. A Streamlit-based web application is developed for real-time user input, providing interactive visualizations and automated health risk assessments.The machine learning models, including classification algorithms from Scikit-Learn, analyze the input data to predict fitness categories. The project aims to encourage health awareness and personalized fitness tracking using data-driven insights.
