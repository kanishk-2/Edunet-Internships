## 1. Shell Internship Project
Project, Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning, leverages data-driven techniques to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crop and fertilizer based on soil composition, weather conditions, and nutrient levels. Using the Crop Recommendation Dataset and Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset, the system processes data, performs feature selection, and trains machine learning models. The Random Forest Classifier is used for crop recommendation, while the Decision Tree Classifier predicts the optimal fertilizer. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate recommendations. Additional visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps help in better understanding data correlations. The model is further improved by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features for better performance.
