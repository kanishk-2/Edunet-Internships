# Fitness Tracker using Machine Learning

## Overview
The **Fitness Tracker using Machine Learning** is a web-based application designed to help users monitor their fitness levels by analyzing key health indicators. The system takes user inputs related to health and fitness, processes the data using machine learning algorithms, and provides insights on fitness levels.

## Features
- **User Input Interface:** A **Streamlit-based web application** for entering health parameters.
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessing and feature engineering using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicting fitness levels using **Scikit-Learn** classification models.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Instant feedback on fitness status based on user inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations.
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn** – For machine learning model implementation.
- **Streamlit** – For web-based deployment.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fitness-tracker.git
   cd fitness-tracker
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application:
