# Disease Prediction Using AI

## Overview

Medical Diagnosis Using AI, leverages machine learning techniques to predict chronic diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s. It utilizes structured medical datasets, applies data preprocessing and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key health indicators. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, are trained to classify disease risk with high accuracy. The model achieves 91% accuracy for Parkinson’s, 88% for Heart Disease, and 85% for Diabetes. A Streamlit-based web application is developed for real-time user input, providing interactive visualizations and automated health risk assessments.The machine learning models, including classification algorithms from Scikit-Learn, analyze the input data to predict fitness categories. The project aims to encourage health awareness and personalized fitness tracking using data-driven insights.
